                <h2>Disclosure is a Dead End: Why the AI Method Debate Misses the Realities of Creation</h2>

                <p>In my previous post, I argued for a principled stance: creators have a right to keep their methods private. This isn't just a matter of personal preference; it's about recognizing the inherent value of the creative process itself and defending the autonomy of the artist.</p>

                <p>But beyond the principle, there are crucial practical and philosophical reasons why the current focus on AI disclosure is not only misguided but ultimately a dead end. It's a debate that's heading in the wrong direction, chasing a chimera while ignoring the deeper shifts happening in the nature of creation itself.</p>

                <p>Let's start with the practical. Right now, asking "Did you use AI?" might seem like a reasonable, if intrusive, question. But we are rapidly moving towards a world where AI is not a separate tool, but an integrated element of our creative environments. Imagine workplaces, software, even personal devices where AI assistance is woven into every step of the process, from brainstorming to sentence structuring, from visual ideation to musical arrangement.</p>

                <p>In such a world, how do you even define "using AI"? Where does the human input begin and the AI assistance end? Will we demand creators dissect every micro-interaction with AI, tracing back every suggestion, every auto-correction, every spark of inspiration that might have been subtly nudged by an algorithm? It's not just impractical; it's verging on the absurd. The lines are blurring, and soon they'll be indistinguishable. Disclosure will become an impossible, and ultimately meaningless, exercise.</p>

                <p>And this leads us to a more fundamental, philosophical point: the demand for disclosure often rests on a flawed premise – the myth of the isolated, individual creative mind. It assumes that authorship springs solely from a singular, bounded consciousness, untouched by external influences unless explicitly declared. But this is a romanticized, and ultimately inaccurate, picture of how creativity actually works.</p>

                <p>None of us create in a vacuum. Our language, our ideas, our very ways of thinking are shaped by a vast, collective inheritance. We are all, in a sense, drawing from a common well of human experience and expression. We didn't invent the words we use, the artistic traditions we build upon, or the cultural narratives that inform our work. Creativity is always, to some degree, a process of curation – of selecting, arranging, and reinterpreting elements from the world around us.</p>

                <p>And in this light, AI becomes simply another, albeit powerful, tool for curation. It's a way to engage with and focus this vast collective knowledge base, to experiment with patterns and possibilities on a scale previously unimaginable. To demand disclosure of AI use is to cling to an outdated notion of individual genius, ignoring the fundamentally collaborative and curated nature of all creative work.</p>

                <p>This isn't just abstract theory. In a recent video clip (which I encourage you to watch, starting at 40:22 in [link to YouTube video again]), Simon Willison, along with other tech-savvy creators, grapples with exactly these questions. They discuss how authorship is being redefined in real-time, acknowledging that it's not about rigid definitions but about an ongoing negotiation of what we value and recognize as meaningful creative contribution. This conversation, happening amongst those actively building the future of the web and AI, highlights that the narrow focus on "AI disclosure" is missing the much larger, more complex, and frankly more interesting conversation about the evolving nature of authorship itself.</p>

                <p>Instead of getting bogged down in the impracticality of policing AI use and clinging to outdated notions of individual creation, we need to shift our focus. We need to ask more nuanced questions about what constitutes valuable creative work in this new landscape. We need to move beyond the binary of "AI-generated" versus "human-made" and start engaging with the actual qualities of the work itself, regardless of the methods used to create it. Because ultimately, the real value lies not in the how, but in the what – in the impact, the originality, and the meaning of the creative output.</p>

                <h2>My Methods Are My Own: Why Creators Have a Right to Privacy in the AI Age</h2>
                <div class="post-meta">
                    <time datetime="2025-01-29">January 29, 2025</time>

                <p>We're in a moment of profound shift for authorship. AI content generation is forcing us to confront fundamental questions about what it means to create, to write, to be an artist. Publishers are scrambling to create guidelines, often demanding disclosure about AI use, or outright banning it. Many creators, understandably, feel threatened and want to draw a line in the sand.</p>

                <p>But I want to propose a different line. A line drawn not in fear, but in principle. A line that, while perhaps radical, is rooted in the very foundations of artistic ownership and creative freedom.</p>

                <p>My position is this: creators have an inherent right to keep their methods of composition private.</p>

                <p>It's a simple statement, but it carries significant weight. It means that when a publisher asks, "Did you use AI in this?" the only truly principled answer is, "That's none of your business."</p>

                <p>Why take such a seemingly confrontational stance? Because the methods of artistic production are as much a part of the creator's intellectual property as the finished work itself. Think about it: for centuries, artists, writers, and craftspeople have guarded their techniques, their secrets, their unique approaches. These methods are not just incidental to the creation process; they are the creation process, the very engine of artistic output.</p>

                <p>Imagine a chef being forced to disclose every ingredient ratio, every cooking technique, every source of inspiration before anyone could taste their dish. Recipes, after all, are considered intellectual property. Why should artistic methods be any different? Just as the chef's recipe is their carefully developed and guarded asset, so too are the writer's unique blend of research, drafting processes, and yes, even tools – AI or otherwise.</p>

                <p>The relationship between artist and audience, between writer and reader, is fundamentally built on a kind of tacit agreement. The artist creates a world, an experience, an illusion – and if it resonates, if it moves the audience, then the artist has fulfilled their part of the bargain. The audience is free to judge the result: is it compelling? Is it original? Is it meaningful? But the how – the specific steps, the tools, the internal processes – that should remain firmly within the creator's domain.</p>

                <p>When publishers demand disclosure of AI use, they are stepping outside their lane. Their role is to evaluate the quality and suitability of the work for their publication. To dictate the methods of creation is to fundamentally shift the power dynamic, tilting it even further away from the creator and towards the already powerful publishing apparatus. Writers and artists, often eager for recognition and publication, already cede significant rights. But the right to control one's own creative process, to maintain the privacy of one's methods – this is a line we cannot afford to cross.</p>

                <p>This isn't just about AI. It's about artistic autonomy. It's about respecting the hidden craft that has always been at the heart of creation. It's about recognizing that the methods, the secrets, the how of art are just as valuable, and just as rightfully owned by the creator, as the art itself. It's time to reclaim that ownership, to assert that our methods are, and should remain, our own business.</p>
