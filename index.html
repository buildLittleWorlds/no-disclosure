                <p>The title comes from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rXCK7TJ9_bM">Bob Dylan press conference in 1965</a>. Dylan was getting pressured at the time to say whether he was a more a singer or a poet. His answer ("I think of myself more as a song and dance man, you know") was his way to say, "That goes to craft and method, and I'll keep those to myself."</p>
                <p>There's always been this push from the outside to force writers, magicians, circus performers, and tricksters to reveal how they do what they do. It's a natural curiosity, but the hidden source of the writer's work should stay hidden.</p>
                <p>A large part of what a writer owns if a writer owns anything at all is the secret of how this particular writer makes a world that's totally made-up feel like maybe it's more real than anything else. That's magic. And a magician never tells.</p>

                <p>Here's what I think about publisher guidelines that prohibit the use of AI. If you're a creator who doesn't like AI and you see these anti-AI guidelines as "being on the right side" in the fight against AI, these guidelines might feel like they rise to the level of righteous activism. But I disagree.</p>
                <p>Who should determine the methods an artist uses for the creation of the artist's work?</p>
                <p>Who should determine the methods a publisher uses for the publishing of the artist's work?</p>
                <p>I say the publisher should be free to use the methods the publisher wants to use for the publishing of material the publisher has agreed to publish. This is what publishers do. Publishers take work submitted to them, determine the quality, select work they want to publish, and then use their technical expertise to put that work out into the world for readers.</p>
                <p>And I say artists should determine their own methods for creating the work they want to create. What is the appropriate response when a publisher asks, "Did you use AI to write this?"</p>
                <p>"That's none of your business. You stay in your lane, and I'll stay in mine."</p>
                <p>If artists give up the right to decide their own methods for the creation of their work, they hand over power to publishers. Publishers already have an out-sized power over the work of artists and writers. Writers are generally so grateful to get the attention of publishers that they sign over most rights to the publisher. But writers should have more respect for themselves as the owners of their own work, including the methods they use to create their work.</p>

                <p>My position is simple. I am against the requirement that creators disclose whether they use AI or not in their work. Writers decide what they want to write about; what they want to say about what they write about; and the methods they will use in writing what they write. These all belong to the writer, and the writer is under no obligation to reveal the methods of his craft.</p>
                <p>This blog is my attempt to work out the implications of this position.</p>
