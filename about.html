        <article>
            <p>I am an unapologetic advocate for creative privacy. In an era where the discourse around AI and writing has become increasingly focused on disclosure and transparency, I stand firmly against the notion that creators owe anyone an explanation of their methods.</p>

            <p>The demand for AI disclosure is not just misguidedâ€”it's harmful to the creative process itself. It represents an unprecedented intrusion into the sacred space where art is made, where ideas take shape, and where writers craft their voices.</p>

            <p>I believe that:</p>
            <ul class="belief-list">
                <li>The methods of creation are as private as the thoughts in a writer's mind</li>
                <li>Tools, whether AI or otherwise, are part of the creator's intellectual property</li>
                <li>The quality of work should be judged solely on its merit, not its methods</li>
                <li>Demands for AI disclosure are rooted in fear, not principle</li>
                <li>Creative freedom includes the right to keep one's process private</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Through this blog, I explore these ideas in depth, challenging the prevailing narrative that transparency in creative methods serves any meaningful purpose. I argue instead that it only serves to constrain creativity and perpetuate outdated notions of "authentic" creation.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in exploring these ideas further, I invite you to read my posts and engage with these arguments. But know this: I will never disclose my methods, and I will always defend the right of creators to keep their processes private.</p>
